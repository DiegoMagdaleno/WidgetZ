1. About
========

WidgetZ is a low-feature C GUI library for use with Allegro 5. It's features include:

- Simple API
- A variety of widgets (buttons, toggles, scroll bars, edit boxes, static text holders)
- Simple layout support
- Uses Allegro 5's event system
- Basic theme support
- Cross platform (tested on Linux and Windows)

2. Requirements
===============

- Allegro 5 (image, font and primitives addons)
- CMake
- NaturalDocs (documentation only)

3. Installation
===============

Standard CMake building instructions apply. Starting in the WidgetZ root directory do:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

Last command may need to be ran at root if you're on Linux. This will build the library and install it into the standard location. It will also build the example, which you can run from the build directory.

If you want the documentation, run build_docs.sh script. It will generate HTML documentation in the docs/ folder.
